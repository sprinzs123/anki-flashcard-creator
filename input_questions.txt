9 What is one advantage that the IPv6 simplified header offers over IPv4?


-smaller-sized header

12 What information does the loopback test provide?


-The device has end-to-end connectivity.
-The TCP/IP stack on the device is working correctly.
-The device has the correct IP address on the network.
-DHCP is working correctly.
-The Ethernet cable is working correctly.
=        The TCP/IP stack on the device is working correctly.;

14 How do hosts ensure that their packets are directed to the correct network destination?


-They always direct their packets to the default gateway, which will be responsible for the packet delivery.
-They search in their own local routing table for a route to the network destination address and pass this information to the default gateway.
-They send a query packet to the default gateway asking for the best route.
-They have to keep their own local routing table that contains a route to the loopback interface, a local network route, and a remote default route.​
=        They have to keep their own local routing table that contains a route to the loopback interface, a local network route, and a remote default route.​;
