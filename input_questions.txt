        segment

Application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media. During the process, various protocols add information to it at each level. At each stage of the process, a PDU (protocol data unit) has a different name to reflect its new functions. The PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite:

    Data - The general term for the PDU used at the application layer.
    Segment - transport layer PDU
    Packet - network layer PDU
    Frame â€“ data link layer PDU
    Bits - A physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium


42 Which two OSI model layers have the same functionality as a single layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose two.)

        network
        transport
        session
        Correct Response
        physical
        Correct Response
        data link

The OSI data link and physical layers together are equivalent to the TCP/IP network access layer. The OSI transport layer is functionally equivalent to the TCP/IP transport layer, and the OSI network layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP internet layer. The OSI application, presentation, and session layers are functionally equivalent to the application layer within the TCP/IP model.
